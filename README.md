# OCR in Python with OpenCV, Tesseract and Pytesseract

Companion tutorial blog post can be found [here](https://nanonets.com/blog/ocr-with-tesseract/)

### Preprocessing of images using OpenCV

Basic functions for different preprocessing methods 
- grayscaling
- thresholding
- dilating
- eroding
- opening
- canny edge detection
- noise removal
- deskwing
- template matching. 

Different methods can come in handy with different kinds of images. 

### Bounding box information using Pytesseract

While running and image through the tesseract OCR engine, pytesseract allows you to get bounding box imformation 
- on a character level
- on a word level
- based on a regex template

We will see how to obtain all of them.

### Page Segmentation Modes

There are several ways a page of text can be analysed. The tesseract api provides several page segmentation modes if you want to run OCR on only a small region or in different orientations, etc.

Here's a list of the supported page segmentation modes by tesseract. Check it out here

0    Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.  
1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.  
2    Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR.  
3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)  
4    Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.  
5    Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.  
6    Assume a single uniform block of text.  
7    Treat the image as a single text line.  
8    Treat the image as a single word.  
9    Treat the image as a single word in a circle.  
10    Treat the image as a single character.  
11    Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.  
12    Sparse text with OSD.  
13    Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.  

To change your page segmentation mode, change the ```--psm``` argument in your custom config string to any of the above mentioned mode codes.

### Playing around with the config

By making minor changes in the config file you can 
- specify language
- detect only digits
- whitelist characters
- blacklist characters
- work with multiple language
